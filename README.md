# Stock-Price-Prediction
Made a Stock Price Prediction Web Application.<br>
• Extracted historical stock price data as data frames using YFinance.<br>
• Applied ML Life Cycle and used Keras to train an LSTM Model for the
training.<br>
• Worked as a team enabling teamwork and collaboration.<br>

The Application and the UI: <br>
